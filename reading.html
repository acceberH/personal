                <h2>Week1</h2>
                <p>It is interesting that hand-coding and self-publishing in the current web environment can be seen as forms of resistance against the commercialized web landscape. They allow individuals to maintain control over their content, challenge dominant narratives, and express their unique perspectives.</p>

                <p>I like how cyberfeminism challenges the portrayal of women in science fiction by critiquing and subverting traditional stereotypes and objectification. It aims to disrupt the dominant narratives that often depict women as passive objects or hypersexualized figures in sci-fi. </p>
